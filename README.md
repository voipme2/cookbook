# cookbook

## Overview

Searching through a binder full of printed recipes is a chore.  I want to make it easier to find what youâ€™re looking for, and start cooking.

Written with a NodeJS backend (powered by ExpressJS).  Everything is stored in a JSON file, which seems to be working fine for now.

## Getting started

Just run ``node app``, then visit http://localhost:8000/cookbook/ to get started!

That's it!
